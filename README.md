## ROM-builder.lua

* Hotkey : J to open UI

* UI
  * Starting point: Starting point of the index, the default value is the mouse position when the hotkey is pressed.
  * ROM Size: The size of the ROM to make; The width and height will be automatically set when their value isn't set.
 
  * Data file path: File path to open. The file should be .txt, or not... I don't know...
    * Data format: Each data should be a decimal or hexadecimal(0x####) number, and their size should not be over 4294967295 or under -2147483648. 
      Each data should be separated to each line. (<- I have no idea how to put them in words; I hope you can understand what I said)

  * 뷁: A button for testing purposes while I make the script. I think you will not need them.
 
  * Orientation: A direction to progress.
 
  * Default value: A value to fill the blanks. When the data size is smaller than the ROM.
 
  * Message from the script: Some random messages will be shown below.
